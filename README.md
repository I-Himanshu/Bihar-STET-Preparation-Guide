# Bihar STET Preparation Guide and Information Repository

## Description

This repository serves as a comprehensive information hub and preparation guide for candidates aspiring to clear the Bihar Secondary Teacher Eligibility Test (STET). It compiles essential details about the STET examination, including its purpose, historical context, detailed syllabus for various subjects, and other crucial information for aspiring teachers in Bihar. Our goal is to provide a clear, accessible resource that helps candidates understand the examination and prepare effectively.

## What is Bihar STET?

The Bihar STET (Secondary Teacher Eligibility Test) is a mandatory state-level examination conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB). Its primary purpose is to certify individuals as eligible to be appointed as teachers in secondary (Classes 9-10) and higher secondary (Classes 11-12) schools within the state of Bihar, India. Passing the STET is a fundamental prerequisite for applying to teacher recruitment drives (such as the BPSC Teacher Recruitment Examination) in Bihar's government and government-aided schools.

The examination is structured into two distinct papers:
* **Paper 1:** Designed for candidates aiming to teach at the Secondary Level (Classes 9 and 10).
* **Paper 2:** Designed for candidates aiming to teach at the Higher Secondary Level (Classes 11 and 12).

## A Brief History of Bihar STET

The concept of a Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) gained widespread implementation across India following the enactment of the Right to Education (RTE) Act in 2009. This landmark Act mandated that all teachers at both elementary and secondary levels must qualify in a TET administered by either the central or a state government.

In response to this national mandate, the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) began conducting the STET to ensure a standardized and qualified teaching workforce in the state. While the specific frequency of the exam has varied over time, there has been a recent commitment to conduct the STET more regularly, sometimes even twice a year, to ensure a continuous pool of eligible candidates to fill teaching vacancies efficiently across Bihar's schools. The core objective has consistently remained to elevate the quality of education by ensuring that only candidates with proven subject matter expertise and pedagogical understanding enter the teaching profession.

## Comprehensive Syllabus of Bihar STET

The Bihar STET syllabus is meticulously designed to assess both a candidate's subject-specific knowledge and their general teaching aptitude. Both Paper 1 and Paper 2 consist of 150 objective-type multiple-choice questions (MCQs), with an examination duration of 2 hours and 30 minutes. Importantly, there is **no negative marking** for incorrect answers.

Each paper is distinctly divided into two primary sections:
